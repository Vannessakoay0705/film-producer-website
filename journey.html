                <p>Since a young age, I have always been fascinated by the power of films. Watching movies that could inspire emotions, tell unforgettable stories, and transport audiences to different worlds made me dream of one day being part of that magic.</p>

                <p>Currently, I am a Year 2 student pursuing a degree in New Media Communication. Throughout my academic journey, I have learned about screenwriting, cinematography, directing, and of course, the crucial role of a producer in managing film projects.</p>

                <p>As part of my next step, I am preparing to gain hands-on experience through internships in the film industry. My goal is to successfully complete my studies, continue building connections in the media world, and eventually produce films that inspire, educate, and entertain.</p>
